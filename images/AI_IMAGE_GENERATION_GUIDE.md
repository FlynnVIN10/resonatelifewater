## TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Images too dark/not bright enough**
- **Solution:** Add "bright, natural lighting," "light tones," "airy," "not dark" to prompt
- **Alternative:** Regenerate with emphasis on "bright," "light," "white background"

### **Issue: Images not water-focused**
- **Solution:** Add "crystal clear water," "pure water," "water as hero element" to prompt
- **Alternative:** Regenerate with stronger water emphasis

- **Solution:** Add "organic," "flowing," "soft forms," "natural water movement" to prompt
- **Alternative:** Regenerate with "not geometric," "not angular," "flowing water"

### **Issue: Images too large**
- **Solution:** Use TinyPNG or Squoosh to compress
- **Target:** Reduce quality to 80-85% for JPG while maintaining water clarity

### **Issue: Wrong dimensions**
- **Solution:** Use image editor to crop/resize to exact specs
- **Tool:** Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Photopea
