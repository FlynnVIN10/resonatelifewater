## FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

### **Rules:**
- Use lowercase letters only
- Separate words with hyphens (-)
- No spaces or special characters
- Include category prefix when appropriate
- Be descriptive but concise

### **Examples:**
- ✅ `main-hero.jpg`
- ✅ `water-flow-abstract-1.jpg`
- ✅ `water-droplets-macro.jpg`
- ✅ `pure-water.svg`
- ❌ `Main Hero.jpg` (uppercase, space)
- ❌ `water_flow_abstract.jpg` (underscore)
- ❌ `waterFlowAbstract.jpg` (camelCase)

---

## OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINES

### **Compression Requirements:**
- **Hero images:** <150KB (JPG, quality 80-85%)
- **Section backgrounds:** <100KB (JPG, quality 80-85%)
- **Aesthetic photography:** <100KB (JPG, quality 80-85%)
- **Lifestyle images:** <100KB (JPG, quality 80-85%)
- **Icons:** <10KB (SVG preferred, PNG if needed)
- **Logos:** <50KB (PNG, quality 90%+)

### **Format Selection:**
- **JPG:** Photos, backgrounds, abstract art
- **PNG:** Logos, graphics with transparency
- **SVG:** Icons, simple graphics (preferred for scalability)

### **Tools for Optimization:**
- **TinyPNG:** https://tinypng.com/ (JPG/PNG compression)
- **Squoosh:** https://squoosh.app/ (advanced compression)
- **ImageOptim:** Mac app for batch optimization
- **SVGOMG:** https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ (SVG optimization)

### **Compression Workflow:**
1. Generate image at full resolution
2. Verify dimensions match specifications
3. Compress using TinyPNG or Squoosh
4. Verify file size meets requirements
5. Test image quality (should remain sharp)
6. Save to appropriate directory

### **Special Considerations for Abstract Art:**
- Ensure patterns tile seamlessly if needed
- Maintain high quality for geometric precision
- Preserve color gradients accurately
- Test with overlay text to ensure readability

## PROMPT OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### **For Best Results:**
1. **Be Specific:** Include exact dimensions, colors, and style requirements
2. **Use Style References:** Reference "abstract art," "architectural photography," "minimalist," etc.
3. **Iterate:** Generate multiple variations and select the best
4. **Refine Prompts:** Adjust prompts based on initial results
5. **Combine Elements:** Mention brand colors, style, and technical specs together

### **Common Adjustments:**
- If too literal: Add "abstract," "artistic interpretation," "minimalist"
- If too cluttered: Add "clean, minimalist composition"
- If colors off: Specify exact hex codes (#007BFF, #000000)
- If quality low: Add "high resolution, gallery-quality, professional"
- If style wrong: Specify "abstract geometric art" or "architectural photography"

### **For Abstract Art:**
- Emphasize "abstract," "geometric," "minimalist"
- Specify "no literal objects" or "abstract representation"
- Mention "architectural-inspired" for geometric patterns
- Use "gallery-quality" or "sophisticated" for premium aesthetic

### **For Aesthetic Photography:**
- Emphasize "artistic," "high-end," "gallery-quality"
- Specify "natural lighting" or "studio lighting"
- Mention "minimalist composition" for clean aesthetic
- Use "architectural photography style" for interiors

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Images too literal/not abstract enough**
- **Solution:** Add "abstract," "artistic interpretation," "minimalist" to prompt
- **Alternative:** Specify "no recognizable objects" or "abstract representation"

### **Issue: Abstract patterns don't tile seamlessly**
- **Solution:** Regenerate with "seamless pattern" or "tileable" in prompt
- **Alternative:** Use image editor to create seamless tile

### **Issue: Images too large**
- **Solution:** Use TinyPNG or Squoosh to compress
- **Target:** Reduce quality to 80-85% for JPG

### **Issue: Wrong dimensions**
- **Solution:** Use image editor to crop/resize to exact specs
- **Tool:** Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Photopea

### **Issue: Colors don't match brand**
- **Solution:** Adjust in image editor or regenerate with specific color codes
- **Reference:** Use brand color palette (#007BFF, #000000, #FFFFFF, #28A745)

### **Issue: AI artifacts visible**
- **Solution:** Regenerate with "no artifacts," "clean," "professional quality" in prompt
- **Alternative:** Use image editor to remove artifacts

### **Issue: Images not loading**
- **Solution:** Check file paths, verify file names match exactly
- **Verify:** Check browser console for 404 errors

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Generate Images:** Use prompts above to create all required images
2. **Optimize:** Compress and optimize all images
3. **Organize:** Place images in correct directory structure
4. **Integrate:** Update HTML with image paths
5. **Test:** Verify all images load and display correctly
6. **Refine:** Adjust based on visual feedback
