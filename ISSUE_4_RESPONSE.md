## ⚠️ DISCREPANCY NOTED

The GitHub issue mentions:
- **Tagline:** "The Frequency of Health"
- **Secondary tagline:** "RESTORING TOMORROW, TODAY WATER"

However, **DIRECTIVE #7** (completed just now) specifically stated:
- **Main headline:** "The delivery method changes everything." (NOT "The Frequency of Health")
- **Tagline:** REMOVE "RESTORING TOMORROW, TODAY WATER"

**Current Implementation:** Following DIRECTIVE #7 requirements:
- ✅ Hero headline: "The delivery method changes everything."
- ✅ No "RESTORING TOMORROW, TODAY WATER" tagline
- ✅ Subheadline: "Most probiotics break down before they ever reach your gut. Ours stays alive—and gets to work."

**Action Required:** Please clarify which tagline/headline should be used:
1. Issue #4 version: "The Frequency of Health" + "RESTORING TOMORROW, TODAY WATER"
2. DIRECTIVE #7 version: "The delivery method changes everything." (no tagline)
